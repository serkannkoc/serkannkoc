<p>
Experienced in <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Vue.js</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>Sequelize</strong>, and using <strong>MongoDB with Mongoose</strong>, I have a versatile skill set and a quick learning curve. Adapting to new technologies, frameworks, and languages, such as Spring Boot or .NET Core, is something I approach with enthusiasm and dedication.
